KEYS

//primary key => unique + notNull
a table can have only one primary key
create table prim(
id int primary key,
name varchar(30)
);
for an existing table
alter table players add constraint primary key(id);

//candiate key
all keys other than primary keys can be called as candidate keys

//super key
subset or combination of keys if they are unique makes it a super key, example emp_id and emp_name combination would
always be unique

//foreign key 
a primary key being a column in another table
example: customer_id as primary key in customers, same custtomer_id being just another column in maybe like transaction table
This can be used for joins

//alternate key
a column that could potencially be a primary key, but is not the primary key in the table.
example : pan_no would be unique for everyone and could be a primary key, but emp_id is the primary key
alternate key is not mandatory

//composite key
combination of primary keys that act as one primary key

CREATE TABLE student
(rollNumber INT, 
name VARCHAR(30), 
class VARCHAR(30), 
section VARCHAR(1), 
mobile VARCHAR(10),
PRIMARY KEY (rollNumber, mobile));

see that a combination of rollNumber and mobile number is the primary key for this table.

//artificial key
adding virtual keys to manage a primary key when it becomes huge.

//JOINS
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table


Equii join : We can use = sign
like : select class.roll_no,placement.cgpa from class,placement where class.roll_no = placement.roll_no;
                     (or)
select class.roll_no,placement.cgpa from class join placement on class.roll_no = placement.roll_no;


Non -equii joins: We can use comparision operators like > < <= >=
select class.roll_no,placement.cgpa from class,placement where class.roll_no < placement.roll_no;
