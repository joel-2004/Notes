//primary key => unique + notNull
a table can have only one primary key
create table prim(
id int primary key,
name varchar(30)
);
//for an existing table
alter table players add constraint primary key(id);

//foreign key 
a primary key being a column in another table
example: customer_id as primary key in customers, same custtomer_id being just another column in maybe like transaction table
This can be used for joins

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
