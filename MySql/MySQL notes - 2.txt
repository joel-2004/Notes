//primary key => unique + notNull
a table can have only one primary key
create table prim(
id int primary key,
name varchar(30)
);
//for an existing table
alter table players add constraint primary key(id);

//foreign key 
a primary key being a column in another table
example: customer_id as primary key in customers, same custtomer_id being just another column in maybe like transaction table
This can be used for joins

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
reference is from the other table Person() with PersonId as its foreign key

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table


Equii join : We can use = sign
like : select class.roll_no,placement.cgpa from class,placement where class.roll_no = placement.roll_no;
                     (or)
select class.roll_no,placement.cgpa from class join placement on class.roll_no = placement.roll_no;


Non -equii joins: We can use comparision operators like > < <= >=
select class.roll_no,placement.cgpa from class,placement where class.roll_no < placement.roll_no;
