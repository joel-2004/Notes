create database mydb;//to create a db
use mydb;//to use that db
drop database mydb;//drop database

//making databse read only
alter database mydb READ only =1;
1 is true and 0 is false
we will not be able to alter it in this mode

//creating table
create table player(
id int,
first_name varchar(30),
last_name varchar(30),
salary decimal(5,2), // 5 is the number of digits before . and 2 is the precision(digits after dot)
hire_date date);

//rename a table
rename table player to players;
rename table <old_name> to <new_name>

//drop table
drop table players;

//alter table
alter table players add phone_no varchar(30);  
//adding new phone number col
changing the name of a column
alter table players rename column phone_no to email;
changing the datatype 
alter table players modify email varchar(30);
//move a col after a col (rearranging)
alter table players modify email varchar(30) after last_name;
//use first to move to the first col
alter table players modify email varchar(30) first;
//drop a column
alter table players drop email;

//insert
insert into players values(101,"loknath","joel",250.00,"2022-12-30");
date format year-month-day YYYY-MM-DD

//multiple inserts
insert into players values(102,"Neymar","jr",270.00,"2022-6-10"),
(103,"Lionel","Messi",280.00,"2023-7-23");

//selective columns
insert into players (id,first_name) values(104,"Cristiano");
remaining will be null

//select 
//where
select * from players where first_name="loknath" and last_name="joel";
greater than or equal to
select * from players where salary>=250.00;
//in date
select * from players where hire_date<="2023-01-01";
//not equal to
select * from players where first_name!="loknath";
//to select from null use is
select * from players where hire_date is null;
//is not
select * from players where hire_date is not null;

//update
update players set last_name="Ronaldo" where first_name="Cristiano";
//updating two values at once
update players set salary=290.00,hire_date="2022-06-10" where first_name="Cristiano";
//updating a value as null
update players set id=null where first_name="Cristiano";
//if we dont use where then the whole column would be updated

//delete
delete from players where first_name="Cristiano";
without where the whole table would be deleted

//rollback,commit
by default our sql is in autocommit, the problem is that if by mistake we end up deleting or updating the db, we will 
not be able to go back
so we use breakpoints to undo 
set autocommit=off;//to turn off auto commit

commit;//i commited meaning a breakpoint or savepoint
delete from players;

rollback;//so after deletion when i use rollback i am able to go back to the last savepoint
select * from players;

//Date & Time
creating a demo table

create table dateTimeTest(
my_date date,
my_time time,
my_date_time datetime);
 insert
insert into datetimetest values(current_date(),current_time(),now());
using in-build functions
date format:YYYY-MM-DD
time format(24 hrs):HH:MM:SS
current_date()+1 =>tomorrow's date 
current_date()-1 =>yesterday's date
can do same with time, will reduce or increase seconds

//unique
alter table players add constraint unique(id);
now the id should be unique
create table players(
id int unique,
name varchar(30),
salary decimal(5,2) default 0.00;
);

//not null 
alter table players modify id int not null;
now the id cannot be null

//check
add check
alter table players add constraint chk_hourly check(salary>=20.00);
makes sure that the salary can be only greater than 20.00
delete check
alter table players drop check chk_hourly;

//default
alter table players alter salary set default 0;
insert into players(id,first_name,last_name,hire_date) value(106,"Jude","Bellingam","2022-4-6");
setting a default value
Jude Bellingam's salary is automatically set to 0
It will be usefull in a ATM to keep track of transaction time, which can be set by default to NOW()
//better to do these while creating the table itself
create table players(
id int unique,
name varchar(30),
salary decimal(5,2) default 0.00;
);

//Auto increment
Alter table football auto_increment = 1000;
the id automatically starts from 1000 and increses +1
//while creating table
create table demo(
id int primary key auto_increment,
name varchar(30)
);

//primary key => unique + notNull
a table can have only one primary key
create table prim(
id int primary key,
name varchar(30)
);
//for an existing table
alter table players add constraint primary key(id);
