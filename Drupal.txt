Content type:
Article - for time related content like news,blog.
Basic Page - a normal basic weba page.

Blocks:
Blocks are like a component in a web page in React, it is like a navbar, sidebar, header, footer.
Block Type:
To create a block type first we need to assign block type. 
To create a block type go to structure -> block type.
In block type we can define the structure of the block, attributes that it would have, manage persmission,manage what to display.
Block:
To create a block go to content -> blocks
After the creation of a block type, we create a block and specify the block type and fill the contents.
Place Block:
to place a block go to structure -> block layout
Then we place that block in a position like sidebar, footer etc.

Themes:
A basic theme is given to us, we can install and use other themes.
To manipulate themes go to Appearance.
There is a separate theme for user as well as admin.
Admin theme is the top most header kind of view that we see that incluedes Back to site, Manage,Shortcuts,Content,Structure,Appearance etc.
User theme is for the website that we are creating.
In appearance -> settings we can change favicon, logo image, what to display.
To add a new theme go to Appearance->List->add theme, them search for drupa themes online and find a compatable one for your version, then add theme with the tar.zip's link.
Based on the themes settings in appearance -> settings would change possibly giving more options.
