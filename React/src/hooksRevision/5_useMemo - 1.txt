useMemo:

	useMemo is a hook which is used for performance optimization in react.
	
	As we know , when there is change in state it will trigger the re-render of the component.

	Suppose the component has expensive opertions then it may take time to compute the calculation and render the component.

	If the operation has no association with state of the component then , when there is change in state there is no need to perform the operation again.

	We can use the pervious result to display in the re rendered component . Cuz there is no relation between the operation and the state .
	so there will be no change in the result as well.

	This is what useMemo hook does.

	It has two parameters , the first one is a function  / callback and the second one is  dependecy array . 

	whenever the value in the dependecy array changes it will execute the callback otherwise it return the previous result.

	The process of storing the previous state result in a cache is called memoization.

	useMemo hook performs memoization.


SUMMARY :

useMemo is hook tht memoizes a value and returns the same value until any of the value in the dependency array changes .
